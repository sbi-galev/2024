## Travelling to Bristol
If you are travelling from London, there is a fast train connection (1:35 - 1:50) from London Paddington. The central train station is Bristol Temple Meads.

If you have to arrive to London by plane and then take the train to Bristol, Heathrow is the easiest airport to do so, as there is an express connection to Paddington. Keep in mind that train strikes are never off the table, but they are announced at least two weeks in advance and there are alternative routes in case this happens.

Bristol has good flight connections to continental Europe. Bristol airport is served very well by bus A1 that takes you to Bristol city center in about 30'. You can buy a ticket by contactless payment or cash in the bus. We recommend a return ticket; it can be used within 30 days and is a better value. Make sure to explicitly ask for a receipt.

If you are travelling from USA, the easiest route is to get a connecting flight through Dublin (Air Lingus).

## Accommodation
You might want to book hotel accommodation early. There are airbnb accomodations close by.

A close by hotel is The Berkley Square Hotel. If you are looking for an economical option, you might consider the Premier Inn, which is not listed on Booking.com.
